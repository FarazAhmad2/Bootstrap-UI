# Complex UI Design using Bootstrap

This repository contains a complex UI design for a website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The UI includes various components such as a responsive navigation bar, carousel, custom CSS sections, photo gallery, Bootstrap cards, and a footer.

## Components Included

1. **Bootstrap Header with Navigation**: A responsive header with a navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. It includes links to different sections of the website and a search bar.
2. **Bootstrap Carousel**: A carousel to showcase multiple images with captions and calls-to-action. It has indicators and controls and transitions smoothly between slides.
3. **Custom CSS Section**: A flex div with three divs inside, each containing an image and a short description.

6. **Bootstrap Footer**: Includes various links, a copyright statement, and a back-to-top button.
